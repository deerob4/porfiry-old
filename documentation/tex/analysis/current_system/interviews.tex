\subsection{Interviews}

A number of interviews were held with staff at the school. Three form tutors were interviewed, in order to gain an insight into how they believe form times could be improved through the use of interactive quizzes, and to get an idea of how they would like such a system to work. Additionally, Nick Bucknall, a head of year at the school, was interviewed; he was chosen in order to gain information on what results the system should calculate, and how best to integrate such a system within the school. He was also chosen to get a further idea of the faults with the current system. Full transcripts for each of the interviews are included below.
