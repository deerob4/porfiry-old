Porfiry
=======
Porfiry is a real-time quiz application designed for use in schools. It is written in JavaScript, or maybe PHP, or maybe - but almost certainly not - Meteor, using an as yet unspecified framework (probably React), with a MongoDB db. This is a project for my A2 Computing coursework, and is designed for use in The Priory School.

Application Features
---------------------
- [ ] Seperate accounts for each form group in the school
- [ ] Seperate accounts for each head of year in the school
- [ ] Interface for adding, updating and deleting quizzes, of different types
- [ ] The ability to answer the quiz in an interactive manner
- [ ] Data visualisations to show the results of the quizzes

More features will no doubt be added as time goes on.

Installation
------------
Simply clone the repository and start up a local server. Really couldn't be simpler.
