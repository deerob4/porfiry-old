\subsection{Interviews}

A number of interviews were held with staff at the school. Two form tutors were interviewed, in order to gain an insight into how they believe form times could be improved through the use of interactive quizzes, and to get an idea of how they would like such a system to work. Additionally, Nick Bucknall, a head of year at the school, was interviewed; he was chosen in order to gain information on what results the system should calculate, and how best to integrate such a system within the school. He was also chosen to get a further idea of the faults with the current system. Full transcripts for each of the interviews are included below. In addition to the formal interviews held with teaching staff, two informal meetings were held with other key members of the school community - Tim Alexander, one of the IT technicians in charge of the school's network, and Michael Barratt himself. Due to the length of these meetings and the unwillingness of the participants to be recorded, full transcripts are not available. Instead, notes on the key topics covered have been listed below.
