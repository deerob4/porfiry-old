\section{Program Variables}
This section displays the variables used in throughout the program. Due to the functional nature of the language used, variables are used freely, so their usage is rather extensive. There are two types of variables used:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Block scoped - these variables, defined using the \textit{let} keyword, are similar to standard variables used in most programming languages, and have been used for values that are in some way dynamic or likely to mutate throughout program execution.
  \item Constants - declared using the \texit{const} keyword, these variables are used for things like modules that have been imported from elsewhere in the codebase, and for variables that read from another source, such as the immutable state store or a \textit{prop} parameter from a parent component.
\end{itemize}

Each variable listed below is accompanied by it's name, the data type it holds (one of \textit{String}, \textit{Number}, \textit{Object}, \textit{Date}, or \textit{Array}), the module or function it is used in, and whether it was defined using \textit{let} or \texit{const}.
