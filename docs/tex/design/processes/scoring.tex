\subsection{Scoring}
Much of the application will

\subsubsection{Calculate House Points}
This function will calculate the number of house points that an answer packet generates, and then compute an up to date list of the current score for either each year or house.
\begin{verbatim}
process housePoints(packet, correct, keys, prop, state = {}) {
  if state is empty {
    loop through each key
    set state[key] = 0
  }

  if answer is correct and peek is false {
    set score = 1
  } else if answer is correct and peek is true {
    set score = 0.5
  } else set score = 0

  return clone of state
  set packet[prop] to state[packet[prop]] add score
}
\end{verbatim}
By taking a property value as an argument, the function can be used to calculate house points for any specified group, making it more versatile. Additionally, by only computing the most recent state for a single answer packet, and using the previous state as a starting point, it becomes easier to apply the function in the real time scenario it will be used in - an average of 22,500 calls per quiz, many happening at once.

\subsubsection{Highest Value in Object}
This function will calculate the highest value in a given object. It will be used in the most common answer function, displayed below.
\begin{verbatim}
function highest(object) {
  set variable keys to array of object keys
  set variable vals to map over object using keys variable for an array of object values
  call max function from standard library on variable vals
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Correct Answer}
Returns true if the user chooses the correct answer.
\begin{verbatim}
function isCorrect(packet, correctAnswer) {
  if packet.answer = correctAnswer {
    Highlight box green.
  }
  otherwise highlight box red.
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Most Common Answer}
This function will work out the most common answers for each question at any one point in the quiz. It works in much the same way as the function for calculating house points, but the appending operations differ so a new function is needed.
\begin{verbatim}
process commonAnswer(packet, keys, state) {
  if state is empty {
    loop through each key
    set state[key] = 0
  }
  
  return Object.assign({}, state, {
    [state[packet.answer]]: 
  })
}
\end{verbatim}
