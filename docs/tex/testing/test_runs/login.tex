\subsection{Login Test Runs}
This subsection contains the test runs for the login screen, using as a reference the login screen test plan available at 13.1.

\subsubsection{Load Quizzes}
This test ensures that a list of all available quizzes can be searched for and found on the login screen, ready to either edit or delete.

As can be seen, all the tests have worked successfully: when there is only a single quiz in the database, only a single quiz is shown; when there are five, all of these are listed; when there is no connection, and the system is unable to perform an API call, the correct error message is shown; and when there are simply no quizzes available, this too is properly relayed to the user. \textit{Success.}
