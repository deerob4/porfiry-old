\subsubsection{Display Correct Results} % (fold)
\label{ssub:display_correct_results}
This section displays how the system should be tested to ensure that the correct results are shown. Due to the scale of the system, there is no way to thoroughly test this functionality through the normal interface, as it would require a large number of devices. Instead, a separate program has been written that simulates these devices; it assumes that the correct answer for a single question is ``A''. Its use is required in this section.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the quiz simulator, insert the following answer packets into the ``packets'' array:
