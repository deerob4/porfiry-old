\section{Process Design}
This section features pseudocode for the vast array of processes that will be used throughout the system. Due to the functional paradigm with which the application will be programmed, many of these processes (referred to hereafter as functions) will be used multiple times, and combined with other functions. To aid in readability, pseudocode for each function will be listed only once. The following is a list of all the processes that will be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create, read, update and delete quizzes.
\item Display time until the quiz begins.
\item Calculate suitable colour pallete for each house.
\item Calculate the number of house points for each packet.
\item Calculate the most common answer in each house / year.
\item Keep state of quiz in sync between each device.
\end{itemize}
