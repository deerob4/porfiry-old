\subsection{Reducers}
These processes will be used to manage the internal state of the application, storing information that the individual components need to function properly.

\subsubsection{Colour Reducer} % (fold)
\label{ssub:colour_reducer}
This reducer will control the colour theme, storing all the different sections in an object that can be passed down to all the application's sub-components.

\begin{verbatim}
process colours(state = call colourScheme(acton), action) {
  if (action = change colours) {
    replace colours with colours returned from colourScheme(action.house)
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
% subsubsection colour_reducer (end)

\subsubsection{User Reducer} % (fold)
\label{ssub:login_reducer}
This reducer will control the functions on the login screen, managing common state like the house and year of the user and the themed colours for the application.

\begin{verbatim}
process user(state = blank, action) {
  if (action = change house) {
    return the action's house
  }
  if (action = change year) {
    return the action's year
  }

    set requestingQuizzes to false
    set requestingQuizzesFailed to true
  }
  if (action = receive quizzes) {
    return current state
    set quizzes to action.quizzes
    set requestingQuizze to false
  }
  if (action = delete quiz success) {
    return current state
    filter out quizzes where quiz.id != action.id
  }
  if (action = quiz is ready) {
    return current state
    set quizIsReady to action.quizIsReady

}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Current Quiz Reducer} % (fold)
\label{ssub:current_quiz_reducer}
This reducer controls all the data needed for the running quiz, and allows it to be accessed by all the necessary sub-components.

\begin{verbatim}

  }
  if (action = leave quiz) {
    set quizInProgress to false
  }
