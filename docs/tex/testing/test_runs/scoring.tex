\subsection{Scoring Algorithm Test Runs}
These are the tests for the algorithms that help to score the quiz. The test generates a collection of fake answers, uses a brute force method to work out the score that these should be reduced down to, and then pipes them through the real algorithm - mimicking the ``stream'' of answers that would happen in production, whereby the final scores are calculated.

As is seen by the tick, the test passed successfully, meaning that the system is able to correctly calculate the winners of a quiz. \textit{Success.}
