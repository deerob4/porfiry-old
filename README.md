Porfiry
=======
Porfiry is a real-time quiz application designed for use in schools. It is written in JavaScript, using an as yet unspecified framework, with a Firebase backend. It includes / will include the following features:

- [ ] Seperate accounts for each form group in the school
- [ ] Seperate accounts for each head of year in the school
- [ ] Interface for adding, updating and deleting quizzes, of different types
- [ ] The ability to answer the quiz in an interactive manner
- [ ] Data visualisations to show the results of the quizzes

More features will no doubt be added as time goes on. This is a project for my A2 Computing coursework.
