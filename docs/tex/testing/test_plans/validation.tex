\subsection{Validation Test Plan} % (fold)
\label{sub:validation_testing}
This subsection displays the test data that will be used to test the validation used throughout the system, and the responses that should occur when the data is entered.

\subsubsection{Only Integers in Question and Break Fields} % (fold)
\label{ssub:only_numbers_in_question_and_break_fields}
This validation will ensure that the question and break fields only accept integers, as they are used in the scheduling of the quiz and so must be validated.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Enter ``10'' into the question length and break fields. (\textit{Typical})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: Nothing should happen, as the data is as expected.\\

  \item Attempt to enter ``abc'' into the question length and break fields. (\textit{Extreme})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: The fields should prevent such characters being inserted.\\

  \item Do not enter anything into the fields and save. (\textit{Null})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: Nothing should change, as the previous values will not have been updated.\\
\end{enumerate}
% subsubsection only_numbers_in_question_and_break_fields (end)

\subsubsection{Minimum Question Length} % (fold)
\label{ssub:minimum_question_length}
Students should be given a minimum of five seconds to answer a question. This validation ensures that this value is enforced when setting a custom question length.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Enter ``10'' into the question length field. (\textit{Typical})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: Nothing should happen, as the data is as expected.\\

  \item Enter ``3'' into the question length field. (\textit{Extreme})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: A message should appear, stating that questions must be at least 5 seconds.\\

  \item Enter ``-8238'' into the question length field. (\textit{Erroneous})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: A message should appear, stating that questions must be at least 5 seconds.\\
\end{enumerate}
% subsubsection minimum_question_length (end)

\subsubsection{Minimum Break Length} % (fold)
\label{ssub:minimum_question_length}
Students should be given a minimum of one minute in a break. This validation ensures that this value is enforced when setting a custom break length.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Enter ``5'' into the break length field. (\textit{Typical})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: Nothing should happen, as the data is as expected.\\

  \item Enter ``0.5'' into the break length field. (\textit{Extreme})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: A message should appear, stating that breaks must be at least 1 minute.\\

  \item Enter ``-8238'' into the break length field. (\textit{Erroneous})\\\\
  \textit{Expected result}: A message should appear, stating that breaks must be at least 1 minute.\\
