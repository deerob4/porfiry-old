\subsection{API Routes} % (fold)
\label{sub:api_routes}
This subsection lists the RESTful API routes - the section of the program that manages the database.
\input{./tex/program_documentation/listings/server/api_routes.tex}
% subsection api_routes (end)

\subsection{API Models} % (fold)
\label{sub:api_models}
This subsection lists the RESTful API resource models, defining exactly what a quiz, form, etc. look like.
\input{./tex/program_documentation/listings/server/api_models.tex}
% subsection api_models (end)

\subsection{Scoring Algorithms} % (fold)
\label{sub:api_models}
This subsection lists the scoring algorithms for the quiz.
\input{./tex/program_documentation/listings/scoring.tex}
% subsection api_models (end)

\subsection{Utility Functions} % (fold)
\label{sub:utility_functions}
This subsection lists the utility functions used through the system. These functions, often used multiple times in different places, are used to extract out common functionality into its own module.
\input{./tex/program_documentation/listings/utils.tex}
% subsection utility_functions (end)

\subsection{Reducers} % (fold)
\label{sub:reducers}
This subsections lists the application's state reducers.
\input{./tex/program_documentation/listings/reducers.tex}
% subsection reducers (end)

\subsection{Components} % (fold)
\label{sub:reducers}
This subsections lists the application's components. Components make up the vast majority of the codebase, as they combine both markup - a description of what should be shown - and logic. The first three components are more advanced, as they interact directly with the applications's state. Other components are less intelligent, and rely on properties passed down from the more advanced components to perform actions and read data.
\input{./tex/program_documentation/listings/components.tex}
% subsection reducers (end)

\subsection{Application Tooling} % (fold)
\label{sub:api_models}
This subsection lists the tooling and build process that is required for the application to run. Though not technically part of the source, a strong understanding is vital if one is to come to terms with the project.
\input{./tex/program_documentation/listings/tooling.tex}
