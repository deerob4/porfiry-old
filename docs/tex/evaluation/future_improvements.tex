There are a tremendous number of ways in which the system can be improved. Perhaps the most obvious is fully implementing the live visualisation system, whereby the current status of each house and form is relayed in real time to each individual user. As set out in the evaluation above, there are a number of factors that make this relatively difficult to achieve, but it is definitely possible.

One possible feature could be the ability to see if a form or house has consistently won over several quizzes. This way, a running tally could be kept of the best form or house, increasing competitiveness between houses, one of the system's inital goals. This could be taken further with a streak system: for every \textit{n} number of quizzes the house has won, they could receive \textit{n} extra house points. Such as system would also allow individual forms that have done especially well to be reported. Of course, such an approach could make it difficult for other houses to catch up and beat the house with the highest streak: by winning just a few quizzes at first, their score would eventually snowball, placing them at an advantage during subsequent quizzes.

To solve this, a ``bonus'' system could be implemented. Every so often, special events, such as a knockout question between just two individual students, could be held, worth a large number of house points. These could take place at random intervals, perhaps between questions or categories, and would likely help to increase engagement with the quiz, an issue that was raised in the interviews. By giving out a large number of points every so often, the ``incumbent'' house with a large streak could be unfooted, making the system fairer.

A further change that might be considered is rewriting the application's structure and backend. The system currently utilises a fairly loose structure, with little coordination between files and directories. It would be beneficial to reimplement the backend in a language that enforces such a structure. A potential candidate for this might be Erlang, a language well suited for building highly concurrent, real-time applications, much like the quiz system. Roughly 40\% of the world's telephone and SMS communications pass through Erlang powererd servers, giving it a well deserved reputation of stability. The langauge also more rigidily enforces a functional style of programming. Though a, largely successful, drive to stick to the paradigm was a key criteria in the current version of the system, there are still certain areas where the code more resembles that seen in an imperative or object-oriented system, or where the code could simply be refactored to be much simpler. Using a more functional language would help improve this.
