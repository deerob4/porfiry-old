\part{Program Documentation}
This second part of the documentation contains a number of sections concerning the finished application. It includes aspects like screenshots of the finished system, as well as a brief discussion of how they are fit for purpose; detailed information on the final database tables, including a diagram detailing their links; a list of every variable used throughout the system, both global and local in scope; and annotated, self-documenting code listings for the entire source of the system, detailing exactly how it works.

\section{Annotated Listings}
This section contains all of code for system, split into several logical categories. The system is made up of a very large number of Python functions, as well as some additional aspects, such as Jinja2 HTML templates to display interface, and CSS to provide styling.
