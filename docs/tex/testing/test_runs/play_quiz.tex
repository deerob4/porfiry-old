\subsubsection{Move Questions on Time}
This test ensures that the quiz moves to the correct questions at the correct time, using the test quiz specified in the test plan. Due to the difficulty of taking valid screenshots of this process, a table is included below with room for a teacher to sign as confirmation that this functionality is working.

\begin{table}[]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Expected result}}              & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Works}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Signature}} \\ \hline
